#WebRTC Rails
---
This is a basic aplication I have build to test WebRTC, my main objective is to practice WebRTC. I will slowly improve the aplication, and add more features each time.

##Objectives
As I said before the main objective is to practice WebRTC but I will list some of the other objectives I have in mind:

1. WebRTC between 2 peers -- **DONE**
2. Clean the webpage of unneeded menus, just the Home page and a page to call
3. Add a chat module (with NodeJs, latter can be improved to be with arbitrary data with RTCDataChannel)
4. Ability to create your own rooms with diferets names, and to setup an user name (for the Chat)
5. Ability to activate and desactivate Video or Audio, and reactivate them 
6. Room with more than 2 people
7. Stream Data to more than 3 people (one to more only), like a conference
